# About Me

**Programming languages I prefer:** While I have mnay years of C# and VB.net experience on Windows, my latest projects and passion has become Python on Linux!  One day VB may become the next COBOL so you better keep me around though!  ðŸ˜†

**Programming/Scripting languages I have experience with:** VBA (Microsoft Office macro/automation), PERL, PHP, PowerShell, JavaScript, a variety of *nix shells (tcsh/bash/sh), VBScript, DOS Batch/CMD etc.  I hearken back to VB6 days also, but dear lord please only contact me if you want to port to .net Framework!

Projects I'm involved in are typically data analytics/reporting, accounting, automation, service provisioning and monitoring related with a mix of platforms.

For project commissions or other inquiries my e-mail is: cdickens@object-zone.net. Of course you can DM me here or at my X/Twitter also.

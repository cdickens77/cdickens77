# About Me

**Programming languages I prefer:** Either C# or VB.net are where I'm usually at.  One day VB may become the next COBOL so you better keep me around!  ðŸ˜†

**Programming/Scripting languages I have experience with:** VBA (Microsoft Office macro/automation), PERL, PHP, PowerShell, Python, JavaScript, a variety of *nix shells (tcsh/bash/sh), VBScript, DOS Batch/CMD etc.  I hearken back to VB6 days also, but dear lord please only contact me if you want to port to .net Framework!

Projects I'm involved in are typically data analytics/reporting, accounting, automation, service provisioning and monitoring related with a mix of platforms.

For project commissions or other inquiries my e-mail is: cdickens@object-zone.net
